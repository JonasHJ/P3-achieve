This repository includes MATLAB files concerning dynamics, kinematics and simulation of the CrustCrawler as well as a Simulink file consisting of the control system.

## Guideline for using simulation:
Add the 'Simulation' folder and its subfolder(s) to MATLAB path to access all used variables and functions. 

Remember to run 'Dynamics/Simulation/ImportVars.m' before running any non-symbolic simulation files.
