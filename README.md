# P3-archive
This repository contains two folders: `C++_code` and `Matlab_code`. The `C++_code` folder contains the C++ source code for the implementation. The `Matlab_code` folder contains all the Matlab files referenced in the report and additional matlab files.

## Guideline for using Matlab code:
Prerequisites:
 - Matlab 2015a or newer
 - install and add to path: [robotics-toolbox](http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox)
 - install Simulink and Simscape for Matlab

Add the `Matlab_code` folder and its sub-folders to Matlab path to access all used variables and functions. The main files are located in the top-level of `Matlab_code`.

If any Matlab file is missing variables, run `Matlab_code/add_to_path/ImportVars.m` and retry.
