# P3-archive
This repository contains two folders: `C++ code` and `Matlab code`. The `C++ code` folder contains the C++ source code for the implementation.

## Guideline for using Matlab code:
Add the `Matlab code` folder and its sub-folders to Matlab path to access all used variables and functions. The main files is located in the top-level of `Matlab_code`.

Remember to run `Matlab_code/add_to_path/ImportVars.m` before running any non-symbolic simulation files.
